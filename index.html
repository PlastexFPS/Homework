            <br>
            <p style="color: aliceblue;">Geralt is a witcher, a magical mutant made for hunting and killing monsters.
                Shortly after being born,
                Geralt's mother, Visenna, gives him away to undergo training and, eventually, become a witcher at the
                School of the Wolf at Kaer Morhen  the stronghold of the Wolven school witchers.[4] His mentor and
                father figure there was a wise man and warrior named Vesemir.[5] Geralt survives mutations during the
                Trial of the Grasses, thanks to which he gains various witcher traits: high resistance to injury,
                poison, and diseases, as well as slowed aging. Uniquely, Geralt had an unusual tolerance for the trials
                and was subjected to experimental mutagens as a result. Due to this, it caused the loss of all body
                pigmentation, leaving him with pale skin and white hair, which is the reason why he is referred to as
                Gwynbleidd in the Elder speech (close to the Welsh translation "Blaidd Gwyn"), meaning <span

            <p style="color: aliceblue;">Cirilla Fiona Elen Riannon (better known as Ciri), was born in 1252 or 1253,[4]
                and most likely during the Belleteyn holiday.[5] She was the sole princess of Cintra, the daughter of
                Pavetta and Emhyr var Emreis (who was using the alias "Duny" at the time) as well as Queen Calanthe's
                granddaughter. After Geralt of Rivia helped lift Duny's curse, Duny asked what reward the witcher would
                like and Geralt invoked the Law of Surprise, as it turned out Pavetta was pregnant with Ciri,
                unbeknownst to Duny.
